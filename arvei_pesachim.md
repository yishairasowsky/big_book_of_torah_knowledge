# Arvei Pesachim
## Contents
## Preparing for the Seder [Mishnah 99b]
### Don't eat
- When? Erev Pesach 3 hours before night.
- Who? Even a poor man, before reclining as "free".
### Financial support
- Tzedakah provides four cups of wine.
- Even if he lives off daily Tamchuy.

## Pesach versus Shabbos/Yom Tov [Gemara 99b]
### Kashya on our Mishnah
- Why specify Pesach? The isur applies to any Shabbos/Yom Tov!
- That is according to R. Yehudah; R. Yosi allows eating until night.

### Two terutzim
1. Rav Huna: Our Mishnah is R. Yosi who only forbids eating Erev Pesach, to eat Matzah with appetite.
2. Rav Papa: Our Mishnah is R. Yehudah, the prohibition on any other Shabbos/Yom Tov beginning at Minchah, versus Erev Pesach which begins 1/2 hour earlier.
### Kashya on terutz #2
- But it is forbidden on Erev Shabbos also a half hour before Minchah!
- This is proven from a second beraisa, which specifies the time of Minchah to include even a half hour before.

## Must one interrupt? [Gemara 100a]
### Terutz defending Rav Papa
Mar Zutra edits Beraisa #2 to forbid Minchah not before.
### Kashya on the defense for Rav Papa
- Mereimar: Rav Pinchas accepted the version which forbids from 9 hours! So we must answer like Rav Huna.
### Kashya on Rav Huna
- R. Yirmeyah rules "like R. Yehudah on Erev Pesach" and "like R. Yosi on Erev Shabbos", which implies they argue about both.
### Terutz for Rav Huna
- R. Yirmeyah was talking about *interrupting*.
    - Rashbam: recite kiddush.
    - Tosfos: take away the table and bensch.
- If you started eating b'heter on Erev Shabbos, then when night falls...
    - R. Yehudah: you need to "interrupt".
    - R. Yosi: you don't need to interrupt.

### Eating in Acre
- Rashbag suggested to R. Yosi they should interrupt, like R. Yehudah's opinion.
- R. Yosi objected, because normally Rashbag tries to make R. Yehudah agree with R. Yosi.
- R. Shimon deferred to R. Yosi, lest onlookers think halachah follows R. Yehudah.

### Psak halachah
- Shmuel rules unlike either R. Yehudah or R. Yosi.- Instead, spread a tablecloth and make Kidush.
- How can Shmuel ignore both Tanaim?
    - Rashbam: Ikar hadin is like R. Yosi, but he is machmir.
    - Tosfos: Shmuel follows a third Tana on amud beis, that spreading the cloth is tantamount to removing the table.
### Contradfictory ruling
- Shmuel: One interrupts for Havdalah, just like for kiddush.
## What constitutes interrupting? [Gemara 100b]
- Removing the personal table before bensching?
- No, spreading a cloth.

### Visiting the Reish Galusa
- A tray was brought in front of Raba
- At what point of the meal?
    - Rashbam: beginning.
    - Rashi: middle, when Shabbos came it
- He spread a cloth and made kiddush.

### Proof from a beraisa
- Ideally, one should not receive a table unless he made kiddush.
- If mistake the table was brought first, spread a cloth and make kiddush.

## When can you start eating?
## Conflicting beraisos
1. R. Yehudah and R. Yosi agree that you may not start after 9.5 hours.
1. At some point, they both allow you to start.

## Kashya on beraisa #2
- Beraisa #1, where they agree it's forbidden to  start can refer to Erev Pesach.
- But when do they agree that it's permissible to start?

## Terutz resolving beraisa #2
- The case they both permit starting can't be Erev Shabbos, because there they argue.
- Must be, they both permit starting before 9 hours.
