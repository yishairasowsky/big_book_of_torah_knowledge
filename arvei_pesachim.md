## Pesachim 99b
## Mishnah: Preparing for the Seder
Don't eat erev Pesach 3 hours before night.
Poor man mustn't eat before reclining as a free man.
Tzedakah provides four cups of wine.
Even if he lives off daily Tamchuy.

## Gemara: Pesach versus Shabbos/Yom Tov
### Kashya on our Mishnah
- Why specify Pesach? The isur applies to any Shabbos/Yom Tov!
- That is according to R. Yehudah; R. Yosi allows eating until night.

### Two terutzim
1. Rav Huna: Our Mishnah is R. Yosi who only forbids eating Erev Pesach, to eat Matzah with appetite.
2. Rav Papa: Our Mishnah is R. Yehudah, the prohibition on any other Shabbos/Yom Tov beginning at Minchah, versus Erev Pesach which begins 1/2 hour earlier.
### Kashya on terutz #2
- But it is forbidden on Erev Shabbos also a half hour before Minchah!
- This is proven from a second beraisa, which specifies the time of Minchah to include even a half hour before.

## Pesachim 100a
## Gemara: Must one interrupt?
### Terutz defending Rav Papa
Mar Zutra edits Beraisa #2 to forbid Minchah not before. 
### Kashya on the defense for Rav Papa
- Mereimar: Rav Pinchas accepted the version which forbids from 9 hours! So we must answer like Rav Huna.
### Kashya on Rav Huna
- R. Yirmeyah rules "like R. Yehudah on Erev Pesach" and "like R. Yosi on Erev Shabbos", which implies they argue about both.
### Terutz for Rav Huna
- R. Yirmeyah was talking about *interrupting*.
    - Rashbam: recite kiddush.
    - Tosfos: take away the table and bensch.
- If you started eating b'heter on Erev Shabbos, then when night falls...
    - R. Yehudah: you need to "interrupt".
    - R. Yosi: you don't need to interrupt.

### Eating in Acre
- Rashbag suggested to R. Yosi they should interrupt, like R. Yehudah's opinion.
- R. Yosi objected, because normally Rashbag tries to make R. Yehudah agree with R. Yosi.
- R. Shimon deferred to R. Yosi, lest onlookers think halachah follows R. Yehudah.

### Psak halachah
- (Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel): The Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah or R. Yosi - rather, one spreads a tablecloth and makes Kidush [then continues eating. Rashbam - really, he holds that the Halachah follows R. Yosi - he was extra stringent; Tosfos - he holds like the Beraisa on Amud B; spreading a tablecloth is in place of removing the table.]

(h)
Question: But Rav Tachlifa bar Avdimi cited Shmuel to say that just like we interrupt for Kidush, we interrupt for Havdalah.

100b----------------------------------------100b
1.
Suggestion: We interrupt by removing the table (they used to have a small table in front of each person; it was removed before saying Birkas ha'Mazon)!

(i)
Answer: No, we interrupt by spreading a cloth.

(j)
Rabah bar Rav Huna visited the Reish Galusa's house; they brought a tray in front of him (Rashbam - at the beginning of the meal; Rashi - he was eating, and Shabbos came); he spread a cloth and made Kidush.

(k)
Support (Beraisa): We do not bring a table [in front of a person] unless he already made Kidush; if a table was brought, he spreads a cloth and makes Kidush.

2)
WHEN MAY ONE START?

(a)
(Beraisa #1): They (R. Yehudah and R. Yosi, who argue about interrupting) agree that one may not start [to eat after the time of Minchah].

(b)
(Beraisa #2): They agree that one may start.

(c)
Question: We understand Beraisa #1 - they agree that one may not start on Erev Pesach;

1.
But when do they agree that one may start?

2.
They do not agree about Erev Shabbos - they argue about this!

(d)
Answer: They agree that one may start before nine hours.
