**Topic**: One Fig at a Time

<img src="..\img\figs.jpg" width="350">

**Warning:**

Despite being one of the shivas haminim for which Eretz Yisrael is praise, it is recommended to avoid eating figs based on the very high chance of finding **bugs** in them. 

**The case is…**

You go to an orchard to buy figs. You say to the farmer, “Here, take this coin, and give me 5 figs.”

**The question is…**

Do you have to be mafrish terumos and maaseros before eating the figs?

**The opinions are…**

This is a machlokess. Rebbe Meir is machmir and says you cannot eat any of them without being mafrish. Rebbe Yehudah is maikel and says you can eat one at a time without being mafrish.

**The qualifications are…**

Their machlokess is davka in a case where the farmer picked the figs and handed them to you one at a time. 

However, if you pick the figs yourself, Rebbe Meir agrees that you’re allowed to eat the figs one at a time without being mafrish. 

Alternatively, if the farmer picked several figs at once and handed them to you, then even Rebbe Yehudah agrees that you cannot eat before being mafrish.

In addition, even if the farmer gives you one fig at a time, still if you have not eaten the first before he hands you the second, then you become chayav because there are two together.

**The proof is…**

In support of his machmir view, Rebbe Yehudah recounts that in the Jerusalem rose garden which didn’t allow shoppers to enter and pick for themselves, nobody ever was mafrish.

**The conclusion is…**

The halacha follows Rebbe Yehudah that one does not have to be mafrish.

#### **Topic**: Yard size

<img src="..\img\yard size.jpg" width="350">

**Background**: Your fruit becomes chayav in terumos and maaseros once it arrives to the front of your house. 

<!-- <img src="..\img\house.jpg" width="350"> -->

**Question**: How big does a yard have to be in order to be considered like a house, i.e. to make the fruits chayav?

<img src="..\img\yard.jpg" width="350">

**Answer**: If the yard is 'guarded' then it is chayav; if it is 'not guarded', then it is patur. 

<!-- <img src="..\img\locked.jpg" width="350"> -->

**Opinions**:

1. **Rebbe Yishmael**: If the size of the yard is big enough that in Tyre they would hire a watchman to guard it, then the produce would become chayav. If not, then it would be patur. 

    <!-- <img src="..\img\guard.jpg" width="350"> -->

1. **Rebbe Akiva**: If there is a single owner of the yard who can unilaterally decide whether to lock it or not, then the fruit would be chayav. But if the yard is shared by two owners who cannot agree when to keep it locked or unlocked, then the produce would be patur.

    <!-- <img src="..\img\unlocked.jpg" width="350"> -->

1. **Rebbe Nechemyah**: If the yard is big enough that a person would not be embarrassed to eat there (long ago there was something called dignity), then the fruit would be chayav. But if the yard is so small, that a person would be too embarrassed to eat there, then the fruit would be patur. 

    <!-- <img src="..\img\sandwich.jpg" width="350"> -->

1. **Rebbe Yose**: More lenient than Rebbe Nechemyah. Even if someone would be willing to eat in the yard, still if the yard is small enough that when you walk in, no one asks you "What are you doing here?", then the fruit would be patur. 

1. **Rebbe Yehudah**: Suppose there are two yards, where the 'inner' one is tucked away so that you can only access it by walking through the 'outer' yard. Then the inner yard is chayav, since it is guarded. But the outer yard is patur, since it is 'not guarded' by virtue of the fact that the owner of the inner yard is allowed to walk through.

**Conclusion**: We follow all the opinions, in the sense that if any of them would say chayav, then in practice the fruits are chayav.

### Mishnah 6

#### **Topic**: Places near the yard

**Case**: You bring the produce to place near the yard. 

**Question**: You bring the produce to place near the yard. 

**Answer**: It depends!

1. If you brought it to a roof, then it is patur, even if the yard itself would makes the produce chayav. But this is only under certain condiitons:

    a) When you brought the produce into the yard, you intended to ultimately take it up to the roof. 

    b) The roof has an area of at least 4x4 amos, which makes it a chashuv place unto itself; otherwise, it is batel to the chatzer.

1. If you brought the produce to a gate house (booth at the yard's entrance), or to a portico (walled on three sides and roofed on top), or to a balcony (from which the people climb down from the upper story), then the produce will be chayav if and only if the yard itself was big enough. In other words, these locations are batel to the yard.
