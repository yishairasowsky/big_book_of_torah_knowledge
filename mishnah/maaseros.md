**Background**: Your fruit becomes chayav in terumos and maaseros once it arrives to the front of your house.

**Question**: How big does a yard have to be in order to be considered like a house, i.e. to make the fruits chayav?

**Answer**: If the yard is 'guarded' then it is chayav; if it is 'not guarded', then it is patur.

**Opinions**:

1. **Rebbe Yishmael**: If the size of the yard is big enough that in Tyre they would hire a watchman to guard it, then the produce would become chayav. If not, then it would be patur.

1. **Rebbe Akiva**: If there is a single owner of the yard who can unilaterally decide whether to lock it or not, then the fruit would be chayav. But if the yard is shared by two owners who cannot agree when to keep it locked or unlocked, then the produce would be patur.

1. **Rebbe Nechemyah**: If the yard is big enough that a person would not be embarrassed to eat there (long ago there was something called dignity), then the fruit would be chayav. But if the yard is so small, that a person would be too embarrassed to eat there, then the fruit would be patur.

1. **Rebbe Yose**: More lenient than Rebbe Nechemyah. Even if someone would be willing to eat in the yard, still if the yard is small enough that when you walk in, no one asks you "What are you doing here?", then the fruit would be patur. 

1. **Rebbe Yehudah**: Suppose there are two yards, where the 'inner' one is tucked away so that you can only access it by walking through the 'outer' yard. Then the inner yard is chayav, since it is guarded. But the outer yard is patur, since it is 'not guarded' by virtue of the fact that the owner of the inner yard is allowed to walk through.

**Conclusion**: We follow all the opinions, in the sense that if any of them would say chayav, then in practice the fruits are chayav.
