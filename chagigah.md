## Chulin guarded as korban [20a]
### Beraisa's 3 views
1. Tana Kama: It's like any Chulin.
2. R. Elazar ben Tzadok: It's like Terumah.
3. Our Mishnah: It's like a korban.
### Diyuk from Mishnah
- Yochanan ben Gudgeda ate Chulin as Kodesh
- His clothing were Midras for Chatas.
- Implying that it was not Midras for Kodesh, like view #3.
## 3 scenarios of guarding
### R. Yochanan ben Elazar
- Case: You drop a handkerchief and a friend picks it up for you.
- Ruling: The handkerchief is tamei.
- Rationale: The friend didn't guard it from tumah, since he assumes you are tamei.
### R. Yonasan ben Amram
- Case: During the week, you accidentally dress in Shabbos clothes.
- Ruling: The Shabbos clothes are Tamei.

### R. Elazar bar Tzadok
- Case: Two women accidentally switched clothing
- R. Akiva's ruling: Both sets are tamei.

### Challenge based on the three scenarios
- We see from the cases above that even if you intend to guard an item, neverthless if someone else was holding, or if you mistook it for another item, then it is not considered guarded.
- But two beraisos say it is considered guarded provided you have in mind to guard it.

## Resolving 2 out of 3
### R. Elazar bar Tzadok
- Each woman assumes the other woman is uncareful about tumah.
- So, she didn't keep in mind guarding the other woman's clothing.
### R. Yonasan ben Amram
- People guard Shabbos clothes from tumah more carefully.
- So, when he guards them on the lower level of weekday clothes, that constitutes a break in their higher level guarding.

## Resolving R. Yonasan ben Elazar
- Couldn't the owner have guarded the handkerchief while the bystadner was holding it?
- We assume that a person does not guard what is in comeone else's hands.

## Kodesh more stringent than terumah [Perek 3; Mishnah 20b]
1. Toveling kelim one inside the other is OK in a mikvah used for terumah but not for kodesh.
2. Parts of a kli cannot become tamei for Terumah, but they can for kodesh.
3. If you are carrying a midras, you may terumah, but not kodesh.
4. Clothes of one who eats Terumah are midras for kodesh.
5. You can tovel clothes for terumah when they are knotted and wet, but for kodesh you must untie and dry them.
6. A keli that was made pure still needs to be toveled for kodesh, but not for terumah.
7. The contents of a keli are considered combined for kodesh, but not for terumah.
8. Tumah can reach revii for kodesh, but only shlishi for terumah.
9. If one hand became tamei, so the other hand is also for kodesh, but not for Terumah.
10. If a kohen's hands are tamei, he can eat dry terumah, but not kodesh.
